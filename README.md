# OSCP-REPORT-TEMPLATE

This repo contains my templates for the OSCP Exam Report. The reports are nearly identical to whoisflynn OSCP Template & Official Offensive-Security Report Template, with minor variations between them.

I wanted to share these templates with the community to help alleviate some of the stress people feel when they start their report.
